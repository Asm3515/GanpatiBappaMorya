# Project Name

## Description

A MERN stack project with backend powered by Node.js and Express, and frontend built with React. The backend is hosted on Heroku, while the frontend is deployed on Netlify. MongoDB Atlas is used as the cloud-based database service.

## Backend (Node.js and Express)

### MongoDB Setup

1. Use a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas. It offers a free tier with limited resources.
2. Create an account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and set up a cluster.

### Node.js and Express Setup (Heroku)

1. Choose Heroku as the platform to host your Node.js server.
2. Create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
3. Install the Heroku CLI on your machine:

    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

4. Navigate to your project folder and create a `Procfile` (without any file extension) containing the following line:

    ```
    web: node server.js
    ```

5. Initialize a Git repository (if not already done):

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

6. Create a new Heroku app:

    ```bash
    heroku create
    ```

7. Deploy your app to Heroku:

    ```bash
    git push heroku master
    ```

8. Open your deployed app:

    ```bash
    heroku open
    ```

## Frontend (React)

### React Setup (Netlify)

1. Choose Netlify as the platform for hosting your React app.
2. Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
3. Install the Netlify CLI:

    ```bash
    npm install -g netlify-cli
    ```

4. Navigate to your React project folder and build your app:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. Deploy your app to Netlify:

    ```bash
    netlify login
    netlify deploy
    ```

6. Follow the prompts, and when asked for the build command, enter `npm run build`.

7. Open your deployed React app:

    ```bash
    netlify open
    ```

Now, you should have both your backend and frontend deployed on different platforms. Ensure your frontend makes API calls to the correct backend URL (the one hosted on Heroku).

Remember to check the documentation of the hosting platforms for any updates and additional information.
